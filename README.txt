  About the coursework
= = = = = = = = = = = = =
For my Software Systems Development AS coursework, my goal was to develop a quiz based application and I opted for a maths based quiz. 

I decided upon the requirements myself, using the MoSCoW system to prioritise them. As a requirement of the coursework, I had to make use of a variety of controls available in Visual Studio such as radio buttons, checkboxes, and drag and drop options. I also aimed to provide players with the ability to create and use their own personal profile which would store their scores. In addition, I hoped to add a leaderboard which would hold the top scores of all players.

Before starting any programming, I designed storyboards on paper in order to provide me with a possible format of how the UI should be laid out. I then created digital versions of the storyboards containing more extensive detail on exactly what controls would be needed and the behaviour of said controls. Once completed I progressed to actually building the solution in Visual Studio. This task involved doing lots of independent research into the different functionality available in the C# libraries in order to add the features I had originally intended. Throughout the course of the project, I also had to document the original aims, paper designs, storyboards, extensive testing, screenshots and a subsequent analysis of the end product.

The final finished project did meet all the core aims I had originally outlined but I was unable to implement randomised questions. However, as the project was more of a demo than a fully fledged application I had chosen to categorise this at the beginning as a ‘would like to have’ aim (MoSCoW). I was very happy with how the aesthetics of the application turned out. The profile system I implemented required much persistence to get up and running effectively and my efforts were rewarded in my overall mark.
